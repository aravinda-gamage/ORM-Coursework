Online Library Management System

The "BookWorm" online library is a popular platform for users to borrow and read books
digitally. With a vast collection of books across various genres, it serves a large user base.
However, the current manual system for managing books, users, transactions, and library
branches has become inefficient and error-prone due to the increasing demand.
The management of BookWorm has decided to modernize its operations by developing an
advanced online library management system.
The key processes of the system include:
1. User Registration: Users register on the platform, providing necessary details such as name,
email, and password.
2. Book Management: Admins add, update, and remove books from the library. Each book has
details such as title, author, genre, and availability status.
3. Borrowing Books: Users can search for books, borrow available books, and return borrowed
books within the due date.
4. Transaction Management: All transactions related to book borrowing and returning are
recorded, including timestamps and user details.
5. Library Branch Management: Books are distributed across multiple library branches. Admins
manage the branches, including adding new branches, updating branch details, and closing
branches if necessary.
